---Awesome Proof (from ahajokes.com)---<BR><BR>

Theorem : All numbers are equal to zero.<br><br>
Given: Suppose that a=b. Then<br>

a = b<br>
a^2 = ab [multiply both sides by a]<br>
a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2 [subtract b^2 from both sides]<br>
(a + b)(a - b) = b(a - b) [factor]<br>
a + b = b  [divide by a - b]<br>
a = 0 [if a=0, then b=0 and any two numbers are always equal to zero.]<br><br>
Furthermore, if a + b = b, and a = b, then b + b = b, and 2b = b, which mean that 2 = 1.<br><br>

---27 Things I Hate About Everyone---<BR>
<BR>
1. People who point to their wrist asking for the time...I know where my watch is pal, where the hell is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I need to ask where the toilet is, asshole???<BR>
<BR>
2. People who are willing to get their fat ass off of the couch to search the entire room for the TV remote, because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually.<BR>
<BR>
3. When people say &quot;It's always the last place you look.&quot;&nbsp; Of course it is!!&nbsp; Why the hell would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people actually do this? Who and where are they?<BR>
<BR>
4. When people say (while watching a movie), &quot;Did you see that?&quot;&nbsp; No dumbass, I paid $12 to come to the theater and stare at the damn floor!<BR>
<BR>
5. People who ask, &quot;Can I ask you a question?&quot; ...didn't give me a choice there, did ya sunshine? Plus, they already asked me a question, so I guess it's my turn.&nbsp; Who the hell do you think you are???<BR>
<BR>
6. When people say &quot;Life is short&quot;.&nbsp; What the hell???&nbsp; Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever does!!!<BR>
<BR>
7. When you are waiting for the bus, and someone asks &quot;Has the bus come yet?&quot; If the bus came, would I be standing here, dumbass?<BR>
<BR>
8. When you are driving and someone asks, &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;&nbsp; Did we stop yet, asshole, I don't think we did, did we?<BR>
<BR>
9.&nbsp; People who say things like, &quot;My eyes aren't what they used to be.&quot;&nbsp; So, what did they used to be?&nbsp; Ears?&nbsp; Wellington boots?<BR>
<BR>
10.&nbsp;McDonalds staff members who pretend they don't understand anything you say unless you insert 'Mc' before the item you are ordering...it HAS to be a McChicken Burger, just 'Chicken Burger' gets a blank look.&nbsp; Well, I'll have a McJumbo Jack and jam it up your McAss, to go.<BR>
<BR>
11. When people ask, &quot;Did you cut your hair?&quot; No, dipshit, I got in a fight with the lawnmower.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
12. When people say, &quot;Oh, do you want cake for your birthday?&nbsp; Do you want to eat it?&quot;. Damn Right! What good is free cake if you can't eat it?<BR>
<BR>
13. When a product is said to be 'new and improved'.&nbsp; Which one is it?&nbsp; If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it, it couldn't be new.<BR>
<BR>
14.When someone calls you up and asks you, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;&nbsp; I don't know, I am OBVIOUSLY talking to you.<BR>
<BR>
15.&nbsp; When you're eating something and someone asks, &quot;Does that taste good?&quot;&nbsp; No, it's REALLY revolting.&nbsp; I always eat stuff I hate.<BR>
<BR>
16. When your wife says, &quot;Do these pants make me look fat?&quot   &quot;No, it's all the ice cream and chocolate you eat that make you look fat!&quot;&nbsp<BR>
<BR>
17. When someone asks me, &quot;Do those glasses help you see better?&quot; No, dipshit, I wear them everyday to make my vision WORSERER.<BR>
<BR>
18. When someone else asks, &quot;Did you get glasses?&quot;&nbsp; This one is so obvious its not even funny.<BR>
<BR>
19. Guys who say, &quot;Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!&quot; ...Oh, I didn't realize that. I thought we were talking about something else.<BR>
<BR>
20. When a cop pulls you over and says, &quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&quot;&nbsp; Uh, hello dumbass you're the one who pulled me over!!!<BR>
<BR>
21. People who say, &quot;It goes without saying.&quot; If it goes without saying, then don't say it. Moving on...<BR>
<BR>
22.&nbsp; People who say &quot;I'm head-over-heels&quot; for someone: literally, we're always head over heels. If someone ever does a hand-stand and actually gets &quot;heels-over-head&quot; for someone...just get the hell away from them.<BR>
<BR>
23. People who say &quot;I could care less.&quot; Hey, that's a NICE thing to say. If you don't care about something, say &quot;I COULDN'T care less.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
24. The phrase &quot;Untimely death...&quot; What the hell is a timely death?...dying in your sleep at age 108?<BR>
<BR>
25. &quot;What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas...&quot; Oh, I didn't realize that they had a dark-secret cloaking device surrounding the city. The only thing that stays in Vegas after you leave is your money...and the fat bastards who took it.<BR>
<BR>
26. Psychics that ask you for your name.  Anyway, why are you taking my crappy 10 dollars when you could be winning the million dollar lottery???<BR>
<BR>
27. I hate friends who send me long, copied-off-the-internet &quot;funny&quot; crap to read, which only pisses me off because it's seldom actually funny.  Even if it is, I always feel guilty for never replying.<BR>

Murphy's LAWs<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
First Law: Nothing is as easy as it looks .<BR>
<BR>
Second Law: Everything takes longer than you think.<BR>
<BR>
Third Law: In any field of endeavor, anything that can go wrong will go wrong.<BR>
<BR>
Fourth Law: If there is a possibility that several things can go wrong, then the one that will cause the greatest damage will be the one to go wrong.<BR>
<BR>
Fifth Law: If anything absolutely can NOT go wrong, it will anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Sixth Law: If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure can go wrong and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop.<BR>
<BR>
Seventh Law: When left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.<BR>
<BR>
Eighth Law: If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.<BR>
<BR>
Ninth Law: If there is a 50-50 chance of something going well, there will be a 90% chance that it will completely screw you over.</FONT></P>
